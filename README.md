# Hospital Bed Utilization Analysis

## Problem Statement
Hospitals often struggle with inefficient bed utilization, leading to overcrowding, delayed admissions, or underused resources. 
Understanding utilization patterns is critical for capacity planning and operational efficiency.

## Objective
- Analyze historical hospital bed utilization data
- Identify trends and peak demand periods
- Build a predictive model to forecast bed occupancy

## Dataset
The dataset contains hospital-level bed utilization information including total beds, occupied beds, admissions, and discharges.
Due to data privacy, a sample dataset is included for demonstration purposes.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis to identify trends
3. Feature engineering
4. Model development and evaluation

## Key Insights
- Bed occupancy showed clear daily and weekly patterns
- Emergency admissions were a major driver of utilization spikes
- Certain bed types consistently operated near capacity

## Results
The model provided actionable insights that could help hospitals improve capacity planning and reduce bottlenecks during peak demand.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in the `notebooks` folder
